    -   A _pion_
    -   A _focus mark_
    -   A _deck_

## Starting the game

1. In a six _players_ game, each _player_ chooses a _character_. In a two _players_ game, each _player_ chooses a color and controls all _characters_ of that color.
2. Place the blue _pions_ on the starting _hexes_ on one side of the _board_ and the red ones on the other side, in any order.
3. Shuffle each _deck_, put an _End of Library_ at the bottom of each and turn each to it's _character_'s _library_.
4. Give each _character_ its _focus mark_, a _Stand card_, an _Alert card_ and an _action mark_.
5. Each _character_ _draws_ 5 _cards_.
6. The first _player_ begins their _player turn_.

## The game

Each _player turn_, each _character_ that _player_ controls gets one _turn_. The _player_ may choose the order of the _turns_, then it becomes the next _player_'s _player turn_.

Each _character_'s _turn_:

1. The _character_ _advances_ its _action mark_.
2. The _character_ gets one _move_ and one _swift move_, which it may spend in any order.
3. The _character_ _draws_ _cards_ until it has 5 _cards_ in its _hand_.

Each _character_ may _discard_ its _action_ or _stance_ at any time during the game.
